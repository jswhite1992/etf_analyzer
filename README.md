# ETF Performance Analysis

This program provides a performance analysis of a FinTech ETF portfolio consisting of four stocks: GDOT, SQ, PYPL, and MELI. It includes interactive visualizations of daily returns, cumulative returns, and other key metrics. The project uses SQL queries to fetch data from a SQLite database and then processes and visualizes the data using Python and the HvPlot library.

## Technologies

This project utilizes the following technologies:

- Python 3.7+
- Pandas
- NumPy
- HvPlot
- SQLite
- SQLAlchemy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
